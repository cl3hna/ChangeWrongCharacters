Polish users only!
Simple WinFrom application which allows you to change wrong characters in your polish subtitles. Assume, that you are downloading subtitles from napiproject but your regional settings are wrong (or you not using polish langauge) - encoding is not working properly and you have weird chars instead of normal one.
You need to specify path to that file (.txt or .srt) and click button "Change Wrong Characters" - below you will see a result of operation.
